This repository contains the code corresponded to the L3 - Hotwire exercice.

I was batteling a lot, and it was very good for my understood about Rails. 
This is a 'beta' submission, despite the functionality works propperly (only whith one post and one user :rotating_light:) , the aplication has tons of bugs and security breaches.
And there is a lot of refactoring to do. I'm conscient.

The code that was gave to download from GitHub's repository `https://github.com/mixandgo/prorb_instaclone` has some issues:
- Wen there are more than one post, the comments didn't shown propperly
  - wen a indistinct comment form is used, the comments are shown allways on the last post
- Wen there are more than one user, everything works impropperly
- And so on... 

- App must be refactored

As you continue to develop the course, I'll keep trying to fix bugs and add functionality as I can!

I will appreciate your feedback, the broader the better :memo: :rocket:
